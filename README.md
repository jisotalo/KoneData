Simple (finnish) Windows program to compare tractor model properties from https://konedata.net/ 

I had a need to compare different tractor models and I also had too much spare time because of a sick leave. Decided to test how .NET Core 3.1 and its new Winforms designer works (= works OK but designer caused ~5 Visual Studio crashes). Also tested html parsing using XPath.

Tech used:
- .NET Core 3.1
- C#
- Windows Forms
- Html Agility Pack (https://html-agility-pack.net/)
- XPath

Probably will break if something is changed at the https://konedata.net/
Created only to be used by me..
